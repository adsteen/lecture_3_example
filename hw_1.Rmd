# Section 1

We can write some text in markdown.

## Subsection 2

If we want to make a new section, we can use the pound/hashtag sign.

If we want to make **bold text**, we put it in between **two asterisks**. *One set of asterisks makes italic text*. 

We can also make bulleted lists:

* Item one
* Item two 
* Item three

Or numbered lists:

1. Item one
2. Item two
4. I forgot how this will render

Finally we can make [hyperlinks](www.google.com) like so. 

Let's make a change.

```{r}
2+2
```
