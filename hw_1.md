# Section 1

We can write some text in markdown. Here’s an addition.

## Subsection 2

If we want to make a new section, we can use the pound/hashtag sign.

If we want to make **bold text**, we put it in between **two
asterisks**. *One set of asterisks makes italic text*.

We can also make bulleted lists:

-   Item one
-   Item two
-   Item three
-   Here's a problem item

Or numbered lists:

1.  Item one
2.  Item two
3.  I forgot how this will render

Finally we can make [hyperlinks](www.google.com) like so.

Let’s make a change.

``` r
2+2
```

    ## [1] 4
